        "In this tutorial we will discuss how to classify cats vs dogs images by using transfer learning from a pre-trained network. This will allows us to get higher accuracies than we saw by training our network from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **pre-trained model** is a saved network that was previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image-classification task. We can either use the pretrained model as it is or transfer learning using the pretrained ConvNets. The intuition behind **transfer learning** is that if this model trained on a large and general enough dataset, this model will effectively serve as a generic model of the visual world. We can leverage these learned feature maps without having to train a large model on a large dataset by using these models as the basis of our own model specific to our task. There are 2 scenarios of transfer learning using a pretrained model:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Feature Extraction** - use the representations of learned by a previous network to extract meaningful features from new samples. We simply add a new classifier, which will be trained from scratch, on top of the pretrained model so that we can repurpose the feature maps learned previously for our dataset. **Do we use the entire pretrained model or just the convolutional base?** - We use the feature extraction portion of these pretrained ConvNets (convolutional base) since they are likely to be generic features and learned concepts over a picture. However, the classification part of the pretrained model is often specific to original classification task, and subsequently specific to the set of classes on which the model was trained.\n",
        "2. **Fine-Tuning** - unfreezing a few of the top layers of a frozen model base used for feature extraction, and jointly training both the newly added classifier layers as well as the last layers of the frozen model. This allows us to \"fine tune\" the higher order feature representations in addition to our final classifier in order to make them more relevant for the specific task involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "**We will follow the general machine learning workflow:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Examine and understand data\n",
        "2. Build an input pipeline - using Keras ImageDataGenerator as we did in the image classification tutorial\n",

        "In our feature extraction experiment, we were only training a few layers on top of an MobileNet V2 base model. The weights of the pre-trained network were **not** updated during training. One way to increase performance even further is to \"fine-tune\" the weights of the top layers of the pre-trained model alongside the training of the top-level classifier. The training process will force the weights to be tuned from generic features maps to features associated specifically to our dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: this should only be attempted after you have trained the top-level classifier with the pre-trained model set to non-trainable. If you add a randomly initialized classifier on top of a pre-trained model and attempt to train all layers jointly, the magnitude of the gradient updates will be too large (due to the random weights from the classifier) and your pre-trained model will just forget everything it has learned.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the reasoning behind fine-tuning the top layers of the pre-trained model rather than all layers of the pre-trained model is the following: in a ConvNet, the higher up a layer is, the more specialized it is. The first few layers in a ConvNet learned very simple and generic features, which generalize to almost all types of images. But as you go higher up, the features are increasingly more specific to the dataset that the model was trained on. The goal of fine-tuning is to adapt these specialized features to work with the new dataset."

        "* Using a pre-trained model for **feature extraction** - when working with a small dataset, it is common to leverage the features learned by a model trained on a larger dataset in the same domain. This is done by instantiating the pre-trained model and adding a fully connected classifier on top. The pre-trained model is \"frozen\" and only the weights of the classifier are updated during training.\n",
